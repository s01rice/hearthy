        Empowering the world with Hearthy.

        Hearthy is built by a small team of caregivers that have taken care of
        our grandparents, friends, and loved ones.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        We know that our loved ones do their best when they&apos;re in the
        comfort of their own home. They do their best when they&apos;re taken
        care of by people they trust.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        But we also know that caregiving is hard work.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        We&apos;re building Hearthy to because we believe all home caregivers
        should be recognized financially for the work they are doing. We want to
        make the process of applying and getting paid for taking care of your
        loved ones effortless.
